# BE_AIML_LAB_Practicals

Welcome to the "BE_AIML_LAB_Practicals" repository, hosted by [Rushikesh Katole](https://github.com/RushiK134), for the Lab Practice-III (Information Retrieval in AI Lab) and Lab Practice-IV (Deep Learning for AI Lab) at SPPU Pune University.

## Lab Practice-III (Information Retrieval in AI Lab)

This section contains a series of lab practicals for Information Retrieval in AI. Students can choose from Group A, Group B, or Group C, and complete any two practicals from each group.

### Group A: CO1, 2, 3 (Any two)
1. Implement a Conflation algorithm to generate a document representative of a text file.
2. Implement Single-pass Algorithm for the clustering of files (consider 4 to 5 files).
3. Implement a program for retrieval of documents using inverted files.

### Group B: CO3, 5 (Any two)
1. Implement a program to calculate precision and recall for sample input (Answer set A, Query q1, Relevant documents to query q1 - Rq1).
2. Write a program to calculate the harmonic mean (F-measure) and E-measure for the above example.
3. Implement a program for feature extraction in 2D color images (extract features from the input image and plot a histogram for the features).

### Group C: CO4, 5 (Any two)
1. Build the web crawler to pull product information and links from an e-commerce website (Python).
2. Write a program to find the live weather report (temperature, wind speed, description, and weather) of a given city (Python).
3. Case study on a recommender system for a product/doctor/product price/music.

## Lab Practice-IV (Deep Learning for AI Lab)

In this section, you will explore Deep Learning for AI, including various deep learning packages and hands-on exercises.

1. Study of Deep Learning Packages: Tensorflow, Keras, Theano, and PyTorch. Document the distinct features and functionality of the packages.

2. Implementing Feed-forward neural networks with Keras and TensorFlow:
   - Import the necessary packages.
   - Load the training and testing data (MNIST/CIFAR10).
   - Define the network architecture using Keras.
   - Train the model using SGD.
   - Evaluate the network.
   - Plot the training loss and accuracy.

3. Build the Image classification model in four stages:
   - Loading and preprocessing the image data.
   - Defining the model's architecture.
   - Training the model.
   - Estimating the model's performance.

4. Use Autoencoder to implement anomaly detection:
   - Import required libraries.
   - Upload/access the dataset.
   - The encoder converts it into a latent representation.
   - Decoder networks convert it back to the original input.
   - Compile the models with Optimizer, Loss, and Evaluation Metrics.

5. Implement the Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) Model:
   - Data preparation.
   - Generate training data.
   - Train the model.
   - Output.

6. Object detection using Transfer Learning of CNN architectures:
   - Load a pre-trained CNN model trained on a large dataset.
   - Freeze parameters (weights) in the model's lower convolutional layers.
   - Add a custom classifier with trainable parameters.
   - Train classifier layers on available training data.
   - Fine-tune hyperparameters and unfreeze more layers as needed.
